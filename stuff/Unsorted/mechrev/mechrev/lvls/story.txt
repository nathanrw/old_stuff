#IntroStart
$Narrator
    In the land of Hermanaia, all was not peaceful.  A power-hungry
group known as Macroworks was pillaging and attacking the peaceful
people of Hermanaia.
They used their amassed wealth to constructed giant mechs known as 
Deathbots to raid the towns and overpower the villagers.  For a long
time, no one was brave enough to stand against the mechs.
But that was soon to change.
$Narrator
    In a small western village called Grandale, there lived a man named Brian.
He had spent his life studying to be an engineer.  His mission: build his own 
Deathbots to overpower Macroworks and get revenge for lost loved ones.
He secretly gathered some other villagers that were willing to pilot the 
mechs.  Using their combined intelligence they were able to build a small 
army.  They formed a group known as the mech revolution.
Their only hope of overthrowing Macroworks and their army of Deathbots
was to fight their way to the main factory and destroy it.

$Gramps
"Well, Brian you've managed to put together a ragtag band of misfits.
And you expect to defeat the Macroworks without any training what so ever.
Sheesh, kids these days."
$mainhero
"Who you calling a kid, Old man?
I'm old enough to take care of myself, thank you very much."
$Gramps
"Sure you are. But you still don't know how to fight at all."
$mainhero
"Fine, then I guess you'd better educate me, Gramps."
$Gramps
"Sheesh, you don't have to be so rude. Anyway lets get to work.
See that mech over there. Go ahead and select it by clicking the
left mouse button."
$mainhero
"What in the world is a mouse button Gramps?"
$Gramps
"Umm... Don't worry about that sonny boy."
$mainhero
"Okay. Be that way."
#GrampsIntroEnd
#GrampsMenuS
$Gramps
"Good, now notice the menu that popped up."
$Gramps
"Select move and left click on where you want to move to.
Take note that on grass, hard ground and metal floor
mechs can move three spaces in one turn."
#GrampsMenuE
#GrampsStay
$Gramps
"If you are sure you made a good move, select stay.
If you made an error, select cancel.
In this case, just click stay."
$mainhero
"Yeah, I never make mistakes."
$Gramps
"Well don't come crying to me when you move in range
of the enemy with one hit left and get blown to bits."
#GrampsStayE
#GrampsEndTurnS
$Gramps
"In order for the game to progress, you need to signify that
you are ready by ending your turn.  Click on an empty space,
and then click on End Turn to do so."
#GrampsEndTurnE
#GrampsMoveAgainS
$Gramps
"Select move again and move through those crates."
#GrampsMoveAgainE
#Tut1EndingS
$Gramps
"Aha, so you didn't move as fast through the crates as you did on the floor. 
Thats because crates and forests take an extra space to move through.
You can check how much various terrain slows you down by highlighting it."
"Also be aware that some terrain like mountains and towns can give you
attack and defense bonuses, although you'll have to figure out how
much of an effect it can have through experience."
$mainhero
"Yeah, yeah, I know how to move the mechs, after all I did build them."
$Gramps
"Just because you know how to build something doesn't mean you know
how to use it properly!  Do you want to die so soon by running off
without checking if things work properly?"
$mainhero
"If I have to listen to you tell me all this boring stuff much longer,
death would be a sweet victory."
$Gramps
"Ehhhhhhhhhhh???????????  Does your attitude know no bounds?
If the fate of the people of grand Hermanaia didn't hang in the
balance, I would end your life."
$mainhero
"You could try."
$Gramps
"<smirking> I have learned a thing or two in my years as a member
of the Town Watch.  At any rate, we are losing time.  We must progress
so you can get out and start taking names."
$mainhero
"For once, we agree on something."
#Tut1EndingE
#tut2s
$Gramps
"Next we have another unit. These are footmen.  They have been
training for months under my command."
$mainhero
"Pfft.  I don't Expect much then."
$Gramps
"They are slower than mechs, and not as powerful, so be careful.
Proper use can turn the tide in a battle, as they have strength
in numbers."
$Gramps
"The amount of footmen in the unit is equal
to the amount of health the unit has.
These two units have been beaten down from all that training."
"They wouldn't stand a chance if we sent them into battle like that.
But together they might be able to do some damage.
When they are next to each other you can combine their forces"
"Do so now."
#tut2e
#tut2afterjoins
$Gramps
"Good job. I must inform you that their attacks are stronger together 
than by themselves.  It is important to use them while their attacks 
are strong, and try and keep them from becoming weak."
$mainhero
"Umm. I already knew that."
$Gramps
"Uh huh. Of course you did. On to the next lesson."
$mainhero
"If that could be called a lesson."
$Gramps
"What did you say?"
$mainhero
...
"Nothing"
$Gramps
"Uh huh.  As I was saying on to the next lesson.
We need to head outside for this one."
#tut2afterjoine
#tut3s
$Gramps
"This thing over here is a power generating solar panel.  It refills 
your mech's small internal battery so that they can work right.
Without power your mech would be unable to attack."
"Different attacks use different amounts of power, and
you cannot regenerate power after an attack, even if you
are near enough to a generator."
"Fortunately, you don't have to worry about power as much inside, 
as the building acts as a generator."
$Narrator
Suddenly a rustling noise in the nearby bushes startles the gang.
#tut3e
#guardtlk1
$Guard 
*gasp* "Eh?"
$Guard
"You're building your own mechs!  Thats against the law. 
I'm going to have to arrest you for that."
#guardtlk1e
#shoots Gramps
#guardtlk2
$mainhero
"You call that arresting? That looked more like...
M U R D E R!"
$Guard
"Oops. My mistake. HAHAHAHAAHAHA!"
$Gramps
"*Cough* You have to avenge my death. *Cough*"
$mainhero
"And why would I want to do that, old man?"
$Gramps
"After all I taught you!  You don't deserve it, but for the good
of the community I shall impart one last lesson.  You must kill him
or he'll alert the city Guards and everything will be lost."
"Move into range and select an attack. 
Mechs have a close range sword as well as long range missiles and guns.
Attack him with whatever you please. "
"Just kill him for me. *Cough* I don't think I'm going to make it much longer." 
*cough* *hack* *Weez*

$Guard
"Finally. He's dead. He was starting to get on my nerves."
$mainhero
"Tell me about it. I had to listen to it for five minutes."
$Guard
"I almost feel sorry for you.
---Almost.
Prepare to die........."
$Guard
".......I mean, be arrested."

Chapter one
The mech revolution
$mainhero
"Okay everyone. Be careful. I'm sure this place is being watched.
We need to take out the Macroworks Guards
without alerting all of them at the same time."
"We might not have a large enough force to fight a mass battle.
We need to make the enemy fight our way, rather than fighting
theirs."
$mech 1
"Rodger that, Brian."
$mainhero
"Okay team. Move out!"

#After you kill the last robot
$villager
"Oh thank you kind sirs. I thought we would never get rid of those mechs."
$mainhero
"No problem. I didn't exactly like seeing my own town
being controlled like that myself."
$villager
"What are you going to do now that you've liberated Grandale?"
$mainhero
"I'm going to go take out the Macroworks 
mech factory and stop this invasion."
$villager
"Really, you're really going to try?
That's suicide, they have way more mechs then you do.
You'll be slaughtered."
$mainhero
"Thanks for your concern. But I have to try.
Someone has to take a stand against them."
$villager
"Well good luck to you on your mission.
If this works you'll be a hero."
$mainhero
"I'm just doing what I have to.
Farewell sir. I hope that things go well while I'm gone."

"And so Brian began his quest
to destroy the Macroworks mech factory.
The factory was built on the other side of a long range of mountains.
The quickest way but not by far the easiest way 
was to make a straight run across the mountains.
Unbeknownst to our hero, Tukar, the head of Macroworks
had sent out some scouting units
to check on what had happened to the strike force in Grandale.

Chapter 2
The Black mountain range
$mech 1
"Tell me again, why do we have to climb these mountains again?"
$mainhero
"Cause its the fastest way to the factory. 
If we went around the mountains
we would run out of power before we reached it."
$mech 2
"These battery's of yours don't last long enough.
You should have taken the time to make them last longer.
These mechs can't handle this terrain well."
$mainhero
"Well, we'll have to make due with what we got."
#Evil units enter screen
$scout unit one
"Hey boss, are we there yet?"
$Branden
"No, were not there yet. When were out of the mountains then well be there."
$scout unit one
"Oh, now you tell me."
$Branden
"Why, oh why do I always get the dumb guys in my squad?
I've been working with the Macroworks for a few years now.
You would think they would bother to give me better men."
$scout unit two
"Hey boss, I think I see something over there across the river." 
$Branden
"Oh really, let me take a look."
#Branden walks over to river
$Branden
"Hmm, those don't look like our mechs 
and their colors aren't those of the Macroworks."
$Scout unit one
"Hey boss, their breaking a law by making their own mechs!"
$Branden
"I Know! I'm not dumb, unlike someone else I could mention.
Anyway the penalty is death. Kill them all!"
#chapter two end
$Branden
"How could I fail? They were just some rebels! Gah!"
#Branden dies
$mainhero
"Well so much for those guys. 
It looks like the Macroworks troops are on the move.
Well have to be a little more careful
cause we don't know how many of them there are at the factory
or heading this way. Just keep your eyes open. Lets move out."

"After defeating the scout unit in the mountains,
Brian's units resumed their trek through the mountains.
As they began to descend down the other side they encountered some trouble

Clearing the way
$mainhero
"Okay team, Were almost there, be careful.
We don't know how many they have."
$mech 1
"I'm beginning to think this wasn't such a good idea.
For all we know they could just keep making
more mechs as we try to break in. We'd never get in if they did that."
$mainhero
"Keep yourself together. We all knew the risk when we took this mission.
We just have to try our best
and hope they don't have that many mechs at the factory."
$mech 1
"Yeah, I guess your right. Sorry about doubting you Brian."
$mainhero
"No problem, we all have some doubts sometimes."
#Guards up in the hills see the good guys down in the valley.
"Guard
"Hey, it looks like we got company."
$Guard 2
"It looks like the the mech revolution that have been causing us a bunch of trouble.
If we killed them we could get a promotion
and we'd never have to do guard duty again."
$Guard
"I like your thinking. Lets squash them!"
#chapter three end
$mech 1
"Alright thats the last of them. Where did they all come from?"
$mainhero
"They must have been watching us from up in the hills.
We should probably keep a better eye out for more hidden troops."

"Good idea Brian. We don't want any more surprises."

"After defeating the border Guards, Brian and his the mech revolution
continued their journey once again.
After a short hike they were finally out of the mountains
and back down on to the plains. 
After another day or two of walking they finally reached
the Macroworks mech factory.
But Tukar was expecting them 
and sent out some guards to 'greet' them at the gate."

"Lord Tukar, those intruders you were just warning us about are here."

"Really? I didn't expect them to get here so fast.
You better not let them inside or your dead."
$Guard
"Umm.....yes....sir."
$tukar
"We need to show them what happens 
if they rebel against the Macroworks.
Send out all the mechs and footmen we can spare to wipe them out."
$Guard
"Yes sir. I'll try my best. Troops lets move out."
#scene shifts to the mech revolution

"Alright guys, there it is. The Macroworks mech factory.
I'm sure they have some kind of defense."

"Lord Tukar they took out our defense's. They're on their way inside.
What should we do? Nothing seems to stop these guys."

"When they enter the factory, have as many troops as we have left ready
at the door, and then lure them to my chambers where I'll kill them myself."

"After cleaning up the Macroworks defense's
Brian and his strike force were ready to enter the factory.
This last battle that was in front of them was sure
to be their hardest fight yet. The stakes were high.
If they won the factory would be destroyed and the enemy scattered
and weakened quite a bit. If they lost however,
the people of Hermanaia would go into slavery for the rest of their lives.
It all came down to who had control of the Macroworks mech factory.

Chapter five
The last fight
$mech 1
"So this is the mech factory. Its bigger inside then I thought it would be."
$mainhero
"Looks can often be deceiving. Anyway we're almost to the core of the factory.
All we need to do is set some explosives to go off after were safely away
and then blow this place to oblivion."
$mech 1
"Alrighty then. Lets get to work."
#When you reach core room
$tukar
"Hello Brian. What do you think your doing? This is private property
and your trespassing. Plus you've killed lots of our mechs and men.
And to top it off you even went as far as making your own mechs.
Of course the penalty is death, but I almost wish
there was something worse then death so that I could give it to you."
$mainhero
"You've caused a lot of people sorrow and misery.
You're the one who deserves to die. I was only acting to save my people."
$tukar
"Sure you are. You 'good guys' are all the same.
You think your some kind of hero but you still killed just as many people
as we did. Your just as much a monster as I am"
$mainhero
"Even if I am I'm still going to undo what you did.
I'm going to destroy your factory so no one has to worry about your
mechs anymore."
$tukar
"Well you seem persistent. Lets just get this over with shall we?"
$mainhero
"After you."
$tukar
"Well then, prepare to die scum!"
#chapter five end
$tukar
"NOOOOOO!!! I worked so hard on these mechs.
I can't lose to some punk like you."
$mainhero
"Why are you smiling? you just lost."

"Not quite. Not if I blow this place up while your still inside.
I mean after all your just going to blow it up anyway.

such a strong hold in this area anymore. Sure they still have mechs
other places around the country but they can't make anymore new ones."
