Version information:
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.10.0 (01/12/03)
        - I've silently gone back to versioning before the 1.0 release.
        - Further improvements of the color selection screen.
        - Removed linoleum compile option.
        - Enlarged the maximum dimensions of the window to 1024 * 768.
        - The editor is now skinnable with IGS-skins, and loads the preferred
          skin at startup.
        - The scrollers are now managed by iGUI scroller routines. These
          replaced my own routines. Now clicking under a scroller also moves
          the scroller.
        NOTE: When using the scrollers while selecting text with the mouse
                it reacts a little different. But i wanted this option to in
                the editor.
        - Speeded up normal text editing, by not refreshing the display after
          each input, but only the lines which contain the changes. This should
          result in a significant speed improvement, especially on slower
          machines.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.9.2 (16/07/03)
        - Speeded up the display functions for displaying selections.
        - Removed the restriction of the dos-syntax being needed for linoleum-
          compile. Now every filename will automatically be converted to dos-
          syntax.
        - Some improvements: The cursor is now forced to be visible after user
          input, which gives a more responsive feeling.
        - Improved some of the routines for working with byte strings. The
          improvements are based on the conversion routines Alex wrote for the
          node and console example. The improvements make editing text a little
          faster, as well as retracing the text display.
        - Bugfix in the cursor, sometimes the cursor didn't blink, when placing
          the cursor on a position. It was marked as a selection of zero
          characters, causing some undesired sideeffects.
        - Layout of the color selection screen changed. There's now as maximum
          space available for the color selection region, which means that the
          desired color can be specified more accurate.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.9.1 (29/06/03)
        - Finished Replace functionality.
        - Bugfix in the color selection screen. The colors are now consistent.
        - Added new option in the file menu: Linoleum Compile. This option only
          works in the following cases:
                * You have downloaded and installed the linoleum environment
                  in the directory: C:\Linoleum
                * The file edited is opened by the complete path.
                  (either passed through the commandline, by drag'n drop, or
                  you entered the complete path in the file-open menu.)
                * The file is passed in DOS-syntax.
                  (e.g. C:\mydocu~1\myproj~1\test.txt instead of
                  C:\my documents\my projects\test.txt)
          In the future i probably will remove the restriction of the DOS-
          syntax.
        - Improvements of the aqua theme.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.9.0 (10/04/03)
        - Added linenumber and characternumber information.
        - Added information about the heapspace in Menu-Program-Heapspace.
        - Implemented undo/redo functions. Accessible via Menu-Edit, and
          through c-Z and c-Y.
        - Improved pgup and pgdn routines, they now work like in most editors.
        - Rewrite of large parts of the routines for loading files, this really
          improves the speed for loading and merging files, and for copy and
          paste functions. Merging pitagora.txt (the largest linoleum library
          at the moment) into another large file now only takes a fraction of
          a second on my AMD 1800+.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.8.1
        - Use of new DynaHeap library, which combines the powers of the resize
          and the lock libraries. This library makes the lock-library more
          stable.
        - Added more shortkeys, and noted them in the menu.
        - Bugfix in the tab routine: when text was selected, tabs weren't
          handled right if the first selected chr was the last chr of the
          selection.
        - Bugfix in the basic matrix insert routine: when the alinea covered
          more than one line in the matrix, inserting cleared the current line.
        - Bugfix in the scrollbar routines: now the end of the file is seen
          when the scrollbar is at the lowest position.
        - Bugfix in the backspace routines: when text is selected, the selection
          is deleted. This is what you expect to happen, but it didn't.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.8.0
The changes in this version justify another minor update. The lock-library is
used for buffers, through a new bmemobj format for handling byte-based memory
objects. All the file-routines are updated, and most of them completely
rewritten. And there's more...
        - Cut & Copy functions implemented, can be accessed from Menu-Edit.
          These routines use the file CopyBffr.txt to store the selected text,
          this way it's possible to let the text-editor interact with other
          applications. Maybe later you'll be able to select the file yourself
          in an options dialog.
        - Paste function implemented. The contents from CopyBffr.txt will be
          inserted at the position of the cursor.
        - The shift key can be used to select text.
        - Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v, Ctrl-x for copy, paste and cut.
        - New routine to load files, with this routine you can also insert a
          new file into the matrix, this is to enable the merging of files.
          In former versions, all chars in the file were checked if they were
          true-ascii. Now this check isn't performed. TABs are translated to
          spaces after loading the file.
        - Merge file option in menu added.
        - As inputfiles the following file-formats are allowed:
          * UNIX: linefeed as newline character
          * WINDOWS: carriage return followed by linefeed as newline character
          * DOS?: carriage return as newline character
          But, for this moment only the windows format is supported for output.
        - The editor colors are also used in the color selection screen, to
          integrate things more.
        - version.txt (this file) can be opened from the about dialog.
        - All files passed through the command-line will be opened.
        - lock-library used for filebuffer.
        - bugfix: the editor now effectively checks if there is permission to
          write a file.
        - removed arrows from editor, they didn't really add something to the
          editor.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.7.1
        - bugfix: the color selection screen had some glitches.
        - find function has more functionality, find from top, from cursor or
          find next result.
        - added normal sized font.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.7.0
This version is totally rewritten and has a better design. There can be some
optimizations, like not having to retrace the whole display for every operation
on the matrix (see the first remark of Version 0.6). It offers almost the same
functionality as version 0.6.3, only differences will be mentioned.
        - Cursor is better designed, especially displaying selections.
        - The font has additional settings, line and character spacings and the
          tab-size can be specified.
        - Find functionality (only from the top).
        - No linodoc.
        - Using the scrollbars when selecting text and the arrows at the side
          of the text-edit area.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.6.3
        - Bugfix: when a delete or backspace was performed on the last character
          of the file, the program terminated.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.6.2
        - Bugfix: A new opened file didn't open when the old file was saved.
        - Bugfix: The program terminated when deleting a piece of text at the
          end of a file.
        - The cursor is also shown when the scrollbars are moved.
        - Linodoc: the first linoleum option, inspired by Javadoc. This feature
          will copy the (linoleum) documentation or remarks in the text to a
          file. Effectively this means it takes the content which is between
          brackets, '(' and ')'.
        - Bugfix: Sometimes when deleting a selection of chrs, the text was
          cleared, but the remaining lines weren't shifted up. This happened
          when the end of the selection was after the end of the alinea.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.6.1
        - Bugfix: typing characters at the end of a line with the insert
          function on, caused garbage characters (from the next line) at the end
          of the cursor, solved.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.6
        - MatrixInsert & MatrixDelete return the lines which are changed, in
          order to update the text display faster
        - Delete & Backspace work with selection of chrs
        - Select chrs in text
        - Changed color selection screens to Gimp-like screen
        - From the about dialog, you can directly open my website with your
          standard browser.
        - Changed scrollbar routines, when you click a scrollbar, the mouse is
          only used by the scrollbar, so even if the mouse leaves the scrollbar
          region, the scrollbar will be adjusted.
        - Bugfix in control loop, program sometimes terminated while resizing or
          while the font changed, solved.
        - Bugfix in insert function, the function didn't add a line when the
          cursor was behind the last chr on a line, solved.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Version: 0.5
        - Added two basic matrix functions: Insert & Delete, all operations on
          the text-matrix are done by these two functions. This makes it easy
          to keep a journal, for undo functionality.
        - Changed version number to two digits
        - Added a medium sized font
        - Set cursor on position with mouse
        - Changed cursor size in normal state
        - Fixed a little glitch in the enter function
        - Changed matrix basic functions in order to work with matrices of
          different lengths
        - Changed FileBuffer (a matrix) size from 16 MB to 4 MB, which should
          be large enough for holding files with less than 65536 lines.
          (which is the constraint for this editor)

        - size: 24.73 Mb (when running)
