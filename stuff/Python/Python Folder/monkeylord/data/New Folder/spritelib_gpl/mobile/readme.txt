Hollywood Squares Mobile Assets

These assets come from a game that I was contracted to do. The developer was completely clueless and
only paid me part of the balance of the work for the project in addition to changing the spec and art
requirements.

They stiffed me for the balance of the contract after trying to trick me to creating additional assets
beyond the scope of our agreement.

These assets are still copyrighted by me but can and should be studied by those in the pixeling community.
